    When I&apos;m ready to start building, I gather all 560 Cubes that I need
    for the project and go to work. The process takes just under 3 hours, as I
    meticulously solve each cube one by one to create the design. It can be a
    very intense and demanding process, but it&apos;s always rewarding to see
    the finished product.
    <br />
    Throughout the process, I always make sure to capture content to share with my
    audience on social media. I believe that this allows my followers to connect
    with my artwork on a more personal level and also helps me to showcase my creative
    process and the hard work that goes into each piece.
    <br />
    Overall, my creative process is a combination of patience, problem-solving skills,
    and dedication to creating something unique and visually stunning. It&apos;s
    a challenging process, but the end result is worth it.
