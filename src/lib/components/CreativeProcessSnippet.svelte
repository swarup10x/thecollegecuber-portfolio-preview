      My creative process always starts with deciding what I want to create. Fortunately, my social media community is always providing me with new and exciting ideas for my artwork. However, for
      the most part, I love creating headshots of professional athletes, especially because I&apos;m a big sports fan. Headshots are more challenging and impressive, which allows me to enjoy my work
      even more.

      Once I have an idea for my next project, the most difficult part of my creative process begins. Creating my designs is a meticulous process that requires a lot of patience and problem-solving
      skills. I learned most of my design techniques by studying engineering, so I approach my artwork like an engineer would approach a challenging problem.
